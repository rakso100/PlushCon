Deep in the ancient forest, a rift opens in the ground. From this rift, creatures long lost to time begin to emerge. Among these wicked beings lurks the oldest of them all—the Horseman. He seeks to unleash chaos upon the world. Those who stand against him must face and capture his legion of Jack-o’-Lanterns, Jack-o’-Ghosts, and perhaps even the mysterious Jack-o’-Moose. Only by defeating the Horseman can the world be saved from darkness.
